`vibe` is a library for acrylic/vibrancy effects for Electron on Windows 10/11. Any Electron version compatible with N-API v6 (Electron v11+) is supported.

---
## Maintenance note
Native support for Windows background materials recently landed in Electron: https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/38163

`vibe` will continue to be maintained until Electron v25+ becomes mainstream.

---

## Requirements
A recent version of [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) (>=1.56.1) is required. You can install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

If you don't plan on doing Rust development, you may choose to install the minimal profile in `rustup` to install a lighter Rust toolchain.

For end users, the Acrylic effect is supported in Windows 10 builds later than build 17763, and the Mica effect is supported in Windows 11 only. `vibe` uses an undocumented API for enabling Mica on early builds of Windows 11 (specifically pre-22H2, build <22523) that is *not heavily tested* and *may not work at all*.

## Usage
> **Note**:
> If you'd like to use `vibe` with Discord on Windows, you'll need to install an additional Rust target: `rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc`, then build `vibe` with `npm run build:windows-i686`. You can then use the resulting `index.node` file like you'd use `@pyke/vibe`.

There are 3 important points you must keep in mind when using `vibe`:
- **`vibe` must do some trickery on the Electron `app` object before Electron loads in order for effects to work**, so don't forget to run `vibe.setup(app)` **before** `app.whenReady()`.
- **Keep the default frame**. Windows gets fussy about frames when you attempt to use acrylic effects. `titleBarStyle` must always be set to `default` and `frame` must always be set to `true`. While there [is a way to have titlebar-less framed Mica windows](https://github.com/pykeio/millennium/commit/0964cb3), it does not work with Electron, and would unfortunately require changes in Electron's internals.
- **Both `html` and `body` need to be transparent in CSS**. It's a common mistake to only make either `html` or `body` have `background: transparent`, but *both* of them need to be transparent. Additionally, you must set the Electron window's `backgroundColor` to `#00000000` to trick Electron into making a framed transparent window. **Do not set `transparent` to `true`**, as this will disable the frame and effects will break.

```js
const { app, BrowserWindow, nativeTheme } = require('electron');
const vibe = require('@pyke/vibe');

// Very important - let vibe perform its magic before the app is ready
vibe.setup(app);

app.whenReady().then(() => {
    const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
        ...,

        // This part is very important!
        backgroundColor: '#00000000',

        // Recommendation: Wait to show the window to avoid an ugly flash of non-acrylic-ized content.
        show: false,
        // Recommendation: Hide the menu bar, as the colour of the bar will be solid and will look janky.
        autoHideMenuBar: true
    });

    // Apply effects! ðŸ’«
    // This should be run before the window is ready to be shown.
    vibe.applyEffect(mainWindow, 'acrylic');

    // To disable effects, run `clearEffects`.
    // The background colour of the window will be black, so you should reset the window's background colour here and/or send a message to the renderer to update the CSS.
    vibe.clearEffects(mainWindow);
    mainWindow.setBackgroundColor('#ffffff');
});
```

The `acrylic` effect for Windows 10 and below can also have a 'tint' applied to it:
```js
vibe.applyEffect(mainWindow, 'acrylic', '#AA80FF40');
```

**NOTE**: The Windows 11 22H2 'Fluent' Acrylic & Mica effects cannot be tinted and will simply follow the window/system theme (see below). You can use `vibe.platform.isWin11_22H2()` to detect if the system is Windows 11 22H2 or greater and style your app appropriately.
```js
const supportsFluentAcrylic = vibe.platform.isWin11_22H2(); // Win 11 before 22H2 does not support Fluent Acrylic
const supportsMica = vibe.platform.isWin11();
const supportsTintableAcrylic = !vibe.platform.isWin11();
```

Additionally, you can use Electron's `nativeTheme` module to force the theme of the acrylic effects:
```js
const { nativeTheme } = require('electron');
nativeTheme.themeSource = 'dark';
```

or, for older versions of Electron:
```js
vibe.forceTheme(mainWindow, 'dark');
vibe.forceTheme(mainWindow, 'light');
```

## Known issues
- Enabling the "Show accent color on title bars and windows borders" setting in Personalization > Colors on Windows styles the titlebar as a solid colour when using the Mica & Acrylic effects.
    - **Workaround**: No workaround, but disabling the setting fixes it.
- `blurbehind` does not work on Windows 11 and later Windows 10 builds.
    - **Workaround**: Use `acrylic` or `unified-acrylic` on these platforms instead.
- `unified-acrylic` lags when moving the window on Windows 11 and later Windows 10 builds.
    - **Workaround**: None, this is a long standing issue with Windows that will likely never be fixed. Use the fluent `acrylic` effect instead;
